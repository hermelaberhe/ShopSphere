ShopSphere - E-Commerce API

Welcome to ShopSphere – a simple and powerful backend system for an online store. This project was built using Java and a tool called Spring Boot, which helps organize and run the code smoothly. The backend connects to a MySQL database, which stores all the information about products, users, and shopping activity.

🏦 What This Project Can Do

For Customers:

Browse all products.

Search for items by:

Category (like Electronics or Clothing)

Price range (minimum to maximum)

Color (like Red or Black)

View detailed information about any product.

Add items to a shopping cart.

Change quantity or remove items from the cart.

For Admins (Store Owners or Managers):

Add new products to the store.

Update existing product information.

Remove products that are no longer available.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java & Spring Boot: This is the main tool that runs the application.

MySQL: A database that stores all the product information.

Spring Security & JWT: Keeps the site secure and ensures only admins can make changes.

Postman: A tool we used to test everything without needing a full website.

🧪 How We Tested It

We used Postman to test every part of the site, like:

Making sure all products can be viewed.

Making sure only admins can add or delete products.

Checking that the shopping cart works – adding, updating, removing items.

Ensuring the total price in the cart is accurate.

🚷 Bug Fix - Search by Price

The Problem:
When users tried to search for items between two prices, the system ignored the price and showed everything.

How We Fixed It:
We improved the part of the code that does the searching. Now it correctly checks the price range before showing results.

The Result:
You can now search for products like: "Show me all items between $10 and $50 in the Electronics category."

📂 How It’s Organized

ProductsController.java: Handles product actions like viewing, adding, or deleting.

CartController.java: Manages the shopping cart.

MySqlProductDao.java: Talks to the database to get or update product info.

Product.java: Describes what a product is (name, price, color, etc).

Cart.java: Keeps track of what’s inside a user’s cart.
